## Question 1 

So, as the question dont especify if the data are structured or not strucured and can be in any format, i prefer to store in a data lake, because data warehouse is mostly used to store structure data to make fast analysis and consults and is also used to get the data and build dashboards with then. Different from datalake its used to store data in raw format and its scalable and has low cost, but if is correctly configured in cloud.

## Question 2 

In this case, data warehouse is more recommended, because the data which are stored is more structured, is more easily to make analysis and see what is happend with your data and answer the question which you need. As data warehouse has documentation of your data relationships well defined, so it is more easily to make querys.

## Question 3 

If sensitity you want to say difficult, data warehouse is more sensive. The explanation about that is because your schema (on-write) defined before the data are stored, it is not flexible to late changes. If we want to change something in your structure, this can change all over your schema and probabily needs to make all adjustments again and load every data again.
